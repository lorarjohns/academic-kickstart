## What's New

As I migrate everything to this site, I'll add more of my professional portfolio, including projects and interactive Jupyter notebooks. For now, check out my education, accomplishments, experience, and CV for more professional info.

## Blog Content

Migrating content from Medium is still in progress, so for old articles, check out my writing [here](https://medium.com/@rayljohns).

<!-- - [On Mathematical Notation in Machine Learning](https://medium.com/dataseries/on-mathematical-notation-and-communication-in-machine-learning-255d119e2aed) -->

I will continue to post new articles [on Medium](https://medium.com/@rayljohns), and they'll also be posted here, so follow me both places.
